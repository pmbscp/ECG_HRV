# ECG_HRV
Python pipeline for ECG signal preprocessing, R-peak detection, HRV feature extraction, and signal quality assessment — developed during my Master’s in Cognitive Science &amp; AI.

The pipeline also demonstrates how I handle self-report data, as well as extract and process behavioral data from a python GUI I built for the experiment.
